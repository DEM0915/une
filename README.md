“我跟你说过不要收拾我的桌子，”尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇说。“你收拾过后，就什么东西都找不到。那张电报在哪儿？你把它扔到哪儿去了？给我好好找下。电报是从喀山发来的，写着昨天的日子。”


“I’ve asked you not to tidy my table,” said Nikolay Yevgrafitch. “There’s no finding anything when you’ve tidied up. Where’s the telegram? Where have you thrown it? Be so good as to look for it. It’s from Kazan, dated yesterday.”


女佣脸色苍白，长得很瘦，带着冷漠的脸容，在桌子底下字纸篓里找到几张电报，默默地把它们递给医生，可是那些都是本城的电报，由病人打来的。随后他们到会客室去找，又到奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜的房间里去找。



The maid–a pale, very slim girl with an indifferent expression –found several telegrams in the basket under the table, and handed them to the doctor without a word; but all these were telegrams from patients. Then they looked in the drawing-room, and in Olga Dmitrievna’s room.



这时候已经是夜里十二点多钟了。尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇知道他妻子一时不会回家，至少要到早晨五点钟左右才回来。他不相信她，每逢她很久不回来，他总是睡不着，苦恼，同时看不起她的妻子，看不起她的床，看不起那面镜子，看不起她那精美的糖果盒，看不起每天总有人送给她并且弄得整个房子里弥漫着花店的浓香的那些铃兰和风信子。在这样的夜晚，他总是变得小气，任性，吹毛求疵，现在他就十分需要昨天他弟弟打来的电报，其实这个电报除了庆贺节日以外，没有什么特别的内容。


It was past midnight. Nikolay Yevgrafitch knew his wife would not be home very soon, not till five o’clock at least. He did not trust her, and when she was long away he could not sleep, was worried, and at the same time he despised his wife, and her bed, and her looking-glass, and her boxes of sweets, and the hyacinths, and the lilies of the valley which were sent her every day by someone or other, and which diffused the sickly fragrance of a florist’s shop all over the house. On such nights he became petty, ill-humoured, irritable, and he fancied now that it was very necessary for him to have the telegram he had received the day before from his brother, though it contained nothing but Christmas greetings.



在他妻子的房间里，他在桌子上一个信笺盒下面找到一份电报，匆匆看了一眼。电报是由一个署名迈克尔的人从蒙特卡洛（摩洛哥大公国的一座城市）打给他的岳母，要她转给奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜的……那电文医生一个字也看不懂，因为用的是外国文字，大概是英文吧。


On the table of his wife’s room under the box of stationery he found a telegram, and glanced at it casually. It was addressed to his wife, care of his mother-in-law, from Monte Carlo, and signed Michel . . . . The doctor did not understand one word of it, as it was in some foreign language, apparently English.



“这个迈克尔是谁？为什么从蒙特卡洛发电报过来？为什么发给我的岳母？”


“Who is this Michel? Why Monte Carlo? Why directed care of her mother?”



他在七年来的婚姻生活当中已经习惯于怀疑，猜测，抓住罪证。他不止一次地想到，由于这种家庭里的训练，他现在可以做一名出色的暗探了。他走到书房里，开始思考，立刻想起一年半以前他跟妻子一块儿到彼得堡，跟现在担任交通局工程师的中学同学一块儿在久勃饭店里吃早饭，这位工程师给他和他妻子介绍一个二十二三岁的年轻人，名字叫米哈依尔·伊凡内奇，姓很短，而且有点怪。两个月后，医生在他妻子的照片簿上看见这个年轻人的照片，照片上有用法文写的题词：“纪念现在，希望将来；”后来他有两次在他岳母家里见到他本人。这正好发生在那样一段时期：他妻子开始常常出门，要到早晨四五点钟才回到家里，老是要求他替她办理出国护照，但他一直回绝她，于是家里持续不断地发生口角，弄得他见到佣人都觉得难为情。



During the seven years of his married life he had grown used to being suspicious, guessing, catching at clues, and it had several times occurred to him, that his exercise at home had qualified him to become an excellent detective. Going into his study and beginning to reflect, he recalled at once how he had been with his wife in Petersburg a year and a half ago, and had lunched with an old school-fellow, a civil engineer, and how that engineer had introduced to him and his wife a young man of two or three and twenty, called Mihail Ivanovitch, with rather a curious short surname–Riss. Two months later the doctor had seen the young man’s photograph in his wife’s album, with an inscription in French: “In remembrance of the present and in hope of the future.” Later on he had met the young man himself at his mother-in-law’s. And that was at the time when his wife had taken to being very often absent and coming home at four or five o’clock in the morning, and was constantly asking him to get her a passport for abroad, which he kept refusing to do; and a continual feud went on in the house which made him feel ashamed to face the servants.





半年前医生的同事诊断他得了肺病，劝他丢开一切，到克里米亚去。奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜听到这个消息，装出很惊恐的样子。她开始跟丈夫亲热，反复说明克里米亚又冷又乏味，最好到尼斯去，又说她要一块儿去，在那儿护理他，看护他，细心照料他。



Six months before, his colleagues had decided that he was going into consumption, and advised him to throw up everything and go to the Crimea. When she heard of this, Olga Dmitrievna affected to be very much alarmed; she began to be affectionate to her husband, and kept assuring him that it would be cold and dull in the Crimea, and that he had much better go to Nice, and that she would go with him, and there would nurse him, look after him, take care of him.



现在他明白了他妻子为什么单单想到尼斯去，原来她的迈克尔就住在蒙特卡洛（两个城市相距不到20公里）。


Now, he understood why his wife was so particularly anxious to go to Nice: her Michel lived at Monte Carlo.




他拿来英文字典翻译电文里的词，揣测那些词的含义，渐渐凑成这样的句子：“为我亲爱的情人的健康干杯，一千次吻她的小脚，急盼归来。”他暗自想象，假如他同意跟他妻子一块儿到尼斯去，他就会扮演一种多么滑稽而可怜的角色。他气得差点哭出来，十分激动地在各个房间里走来走去。他的自尊心，他那平民般的洁癖，在他心里翻腾起来。他憎恶得握紧拳头，皱起眉头，问他自己：他，一个乡村教士的儿子，一个受过宗教学校教育的学生，一个直心肠的、粗鲁的、以外科医师为业的人，怎么会甘愿当这个软弱的、无聊的、出卖灵魂的、下流的人的奴隶，那么丢脸地受这个人的束缚。


He took an English dictionary, and translating the words, and guessing their meaning, by degrees he put together the following sentence: “I drink to the health of my beloved darling, and kiss her little foot a thousand times, and am impatiently expecting her arrival.” He pictured the pitiable, ludicrous part he would play if he had agreed to go to Nice with his wife. He felt so mortified that he almost shed tears and began pacing to and fro through all the rooms of the flat in great agitation. His pride, his plebeian fastidiousness, was revolted. Clenching his fists and scowling with disgust, he wondered how he, the son of a village priest, brought up in a clerical school, a plain, straightforward man, a surgeon by profession–how could he have let himself be enslaved, have sunk into such shameful bondage to this weak, worthless, mercenary, low creature.






“小脚！”他揉皱那张电报，嘟哝说。“小脚！”


“‘Little foot’!” he muttered to himself, crumpling up the telegram; “‘little foot’!”




自从他爱上她，向她求婚，随后跟她共同生活七年以来，在他的回忆里留下的就只有一头香喷喷的长发，一团柔软的花边，一双确实很小很美的脚。直到现在，他的手上和脸上似乎还保留着从旧日的拥抱中留下的丝绸和花边的感觉，别的就什么也没有了。要是不算上发癔症、尖叫、责难、威胁、老脸皮的和负心的谎话，那就真的再也没有什么别的了。……他记起从前在乡下他父亲的家里，往往会有一只鸟无意中从院子里飞进屋里来，开始猛烈地撞击玻璃，打翻各种物件，如今这个女人也是从一个他完全陌生的圈子里飞进他的生活，把他的生活搅得乱七八糟。他一生中最好的岁月象在地狱里那样度过，幸福的希望破灭了，受到了嘲弄，他的健康丧失了，他的各个房间里满是庸俗的、妓院般的摆设。他每年挣一万卢布，却无论如何也抽不出哪怕十个卢布来汇给他的身为传教士妻子的母亲，而且已经欠下一万五千卢布的债务，立了借据。看来，即使他家里住上一伙强盗，他的生活也不至于这样，这样无可挽回地毁了；由于这个女人的存在。


Of the time when he fell in love and proposed to her, and the seven years that he had been living with her, all that remained in his memory was her long, fragrant hair, a mass of soft lace, and her little feet, which certainly were very small, beautiful feet; and even now it seemed as though he still had from those old embraces the feeling of lace and silk upon his hands and face–and nothing more. Nothing more–that is, not counting hysterics, shrieks, reproaches, threats, and lies–brazen, treacherous lies. He remembered how in his father’s house in the village a bird would sometimes chance to fly in from the open air into the house and would struggle desperately against the window-panes and upset things; so this woman from a class utterly alien to him had flown into his life and made complete havoc of it. The best years of his life had been spent as though in hell, his hopes for happiness shattered and turned into a mockery, his health gone, his rooms as vulgar in their atmosphere as a cocotte’s, and of the ten thousand he earned every year he could never save ten roubles to send his old mother in the village, and his debts were already about fifteen thousand. It seemed that if a band of brigands had been living in his rooms his life would not have been so hopelessly, so irremediably ruined as by the presence of this woman.





他咳嗽起来，不住地喘气。应该躺到床上去，暖和一下才对，可是他做不到，仍旧在各个房间里走来走去，或者挨着桌子坐下，拿起一管铅笔烦躁地在纸上画着，信手写道：

“试笔……小脚”



He began coughing and gasping for breath. He ought to have gone to bed and got warm, but he could not. He kept walking about the rooms, or sat down to the table, nervously fidgeting with a pencil and scribbling mechanically on a paper.

“Trying a pen. . . . A little foot.”



将近五点钟，他浑身衰弱，把一切罪责都加在自己一个人身上了。这时候他觉得，假如奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜嫁给另外一个人，而那个人能够对她产生良好的影响，那么，谁知道呢，说不定最后她会成为一个善良、诚实的女人；而他呢，却摸不透别人的心理，不懂得女人的心，况且他又不招人喜欢，粗鲁……

By five o’clock he grew weaker and threw all the blame on himself. It seemed to him now that if Olga Dmitrievna had married someone else who might have had a good influence over her–who knows?– she might after all have become a good, straightforward woman. He was a poor psychologist, and knew nothing of the female heart; besides, he was churlish, uninteresting. . . .





“我命不久矣，”他想，“我是个死人了，不应该妨碍活人。现在，实际上，再坚持我的某些权利，未免显得奇怪而愚蠢。我索性跟她说穿，让她到她心爱的人那儿去好了……我跟她离婚吧，自己承担责任就是了。”


“I haven’t long to live now,” he thought. “I am a dead man, and ought not to stand in the way of the living. It would be strange and stupid to insist upon one’s rights now. I’ll have it out with her; let her go to the man she loves. . . . I’ll give her a divorce. I’ll take the blame on myself.”



奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜终于回来了，照她原来的打扮，穿着白斗篷，戴着帽子，穿着套鞋，走进他的书房里来，往圈椅上一坐。



Olga Dmitrievna came in at last, and she walked into the study and sank into a chair just as she was in her white cloak, hat, and overboots.


“那个讨厌的胖孩子，”她说，呼呼地喘气，哭出来了。“简直不老实，真可恶，”她说着跺一下脚。“我真受不了，受不了，受不了！”


“The nasty, fat boy,” she said with a sob, breathing hard. “It’s really dishonest; it’s disgusting.” She stamped. “I can’t put up with it; I can’t, I can’t!”



“什么事啊？”尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇问，朝她走去。

“What’s the matter?” asked Nikolay Yevgrafitch, going up to her.


“刚才大学生阿扎科夫送我回家，把我的手提包弄丢了，手提包里有十五个卢布呢。这钱是我在我妈那儿拿的。”


“That student, Azarbekov, was seeing me home, and he lost my bag, and there was fifteen roubles in it. I borrowed it from mamma.”



她哭得挺伤心，像个小姑娘一样，不但她的手绢，就连她的手套也给泪水沾湿了。



She was crying in a most genuine way, like a little girl, and not only her handkerchief, but even her gloves, were wet with tears.




“那有什么办法呢！”医生叹道。“丢了就丢了，别去管它了。你安静一下，我有话要跟你说。”


“It can’t be helped!” said the doctor. “If he’s lost it, he’s lost it, and it’s no good worrying over it. Calm yourself; I want to talk to you.”




“我又不像富豪那样，可以毫不在乎钱的问题。他说他会还我钱，可是我不相信，因为他穷……”



“I am not a millionaire to lose money like that. He says he’ll pay it back, but I don’t believe him; he’s poor . . .”



她的丈夫请求她安静下来，听他讲话，可是她不厅地说那个大学生，说她丢掉的那十五个卢布。


Her husband begged her to calm herself and to listen to him, but she kept on talking of the student and of the fifteen roubles she had lost.



“哎，明天我给你二十五个卢布就是，如果你闭嘴的话”他生气地说。

“Ach! I’ll give you twenty-five roubles tomorrow if you’ll only hold your tongue!” he said irritably.



“我得换掉衣服啊！”她哭着说。“要是穿着皮大衣，我就不能严肃地讲话！你也真是怪里怪气的！”

“I must take off my things!” she said, crying. “I can’t talk seriously in my fur coat! How strange you are!”



他帮她脱掉皮大衣和套鞋，同时闻到白葡萄酒的气味，她吃牡蛎的时候总爱喝这种酒（尽管她生得娇小，却吃得很多，喝得也不少）。她到她的房间去了，过不多久就走回来，已经换好衣服，扑了粉，眼睛上带着泪痕，坐下来，整个身子裹在她那件单薄的、镶着花边的、宽大的长外衣里。在一大堆粉红色的波纹当中，她丈夫只看得见她蓬松的头发和穿着拖鞋的小脚。



He helped her off with her coat and overboots, detecting as he did so the smell of the white wine she liked to drink with oysters (in spite of her etherealness she ate and drank a great deal). She went into her room and came back soon after, having changed her things and powdered her face, though her eyes still showed traces of tears. She sat down, retreating into her light, lacy dressing-gown, and in the mass of billowy pink her husband could see nothing but her hair, which she had let down, and her little foot wearing a slipper.




“你想谈什么呢？”她问，在圈椅上摇晃着身子。


“What do you want to talk about?” she asked, swinging herself in a rocking-chair.


“我无意中看到了这个;”医生把电报递给她说。

“I happened to see this;” and he handed her the telegram.


她看完电报，耸了耸肩膀。

She read it and shrugged her shoulders.



“这有什么呢？”她说，身子摇晃得更厉害了。“这是普通的新年贺电，没有别的意思。这里面没有什么秘密。”


“Well?” she said, rocking herself faster. “That’s the usual New Year’s greeting and nothing else. There are no secrets in it.”



“你盘算着我看不懂英文。对，我不懂英文，可我有字典。这是尼斯发来的电报；他为他的情人的健康干杯，吻你一千次。暂且不谈这些，”医生匆匆地接着说。“我根本不打算责备你，或和你吵一架。我们都闹得够多了，现在是时候做个了结了……我想对你说：你现在自由了，可以按自己的意愿去生活。”


“You are reckoning on my not knowing English. No, I don’t know it; but I have a dictionary. That telegram is from Riss; he drinks to the health of his beloved and sends you a thousand kisses. But let us leave that,” the doctor went on hurriedly. “I don’t in the least want to reproach you or make a scene. We’ve had scenes and reproaches enough; it’s time to make an end of them. . . . This is what I want to say to you: you are free, and can live as you like.”



他们沉默了一会儿。她轻声哭起来。

There was a silence. She began crying quietly.



“我让你此后不必再伪装和撒谎了，”尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇接着说。“要是你爱这个年轻人，你尽管去爱，要是你想到国外去找他，你也尽管去找。你年轻，健康，而我已是废人，命不久矣。总之……你明白我的意思。”



“I set you free from the necessity of lying and keeping up pretences,” Nikolay Yevgrafitch continued. “If you love that young man, love him; if you want to go abroad to him, go. You are young, healthy, and I am a wreck, and haven’t long to live. In short . . . you understand me.”



他心情激动，讲不下去了。奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜哭着，用一种自己怜惜自己的口气承认她爱尼斯，常跟他一块儿坐车出城去兜风，常到他的旅馆房间去，她目前也确实很想到国外去。


He was agitated and could not go on. Olga Dmitrievna, crying and speaking in a voice of self-pity, acknowledged that she loved Riss, and used to drive out of town with him and see him in his rooms, and now she really did long to go abroad.



“你看，我什么也没有隐瞒，”她叹了一口气，说。“我的整个灵魂都敞开了。我再一次要求你，请你宽宏大量，给我办个护照😭”


“You see, I hide nothing from you,” she added, with a sigh. “My whole soul lies open before you. And I beg you again, be generous, get me a passport.”



“我再说一遍：你现在自由了。”


“I repeat, you are free.”



她换了个位子，坐得离他近一点，好看清他脸上的神情。她不信他的话，现在想弄明白他暗藏在心里的想法。她从没相信过任何人，不管别人的意图多么高尚，她总是怀疑其中含着什么卑鄙恶劣的动机和利己主义的目的。她用锐利的目光端详着他的脸，他觉得她的眼睛似乎像猫眼睛那样闪着绿色的亮光。



She moved to another seat nearer him to look at the expression of his face. She did not believe him and wanted now to understand his secret meaning. She never did believe any one, and however generous were their intentions, she always suspected some petty or ignoble motive or selfish object in them. And when she looked searchingly into his face, it seemed to him that there was a gleam of green light in her eyes as in a cat’s.



“那我什么时候才能拿到护照呢？”她轻声问道。

“When shall I get the passport?” she asked softly.



他忽然想说一声“混蛋！去死！”，可是他忍住了，说：

“随你的意。”

“我只去一个月。”


He suddenly had an impulse to say “Never”; but he restrained himself and said:

“When you like.”

“I shall only go for a month.”




“你到尼斯那儿去，可以从此不回来。我会跟你离婚，自己承担责任，你就可以和他结婚了。”


“You’ll go to Riss for good. I’ll get you a divorce, take the blame on myself, and Riss can marry you.”



“可是我根本不打算离婚！”奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜很快地说，做出惊讶的脸容。“我并没有要求跟你离婚！给我护照，就这样。”

“But I don’t want a divorce!” Olga Dmitrievna retorted quickly, with an astonished face. “I am not asking you for a divorce! Get me a passport, that’s all.”


“可是你为什么不想离婚呢？”医生问，开始生气了。“你是个奇怪的女人。你多么奇怪啊！要是你真正迷恋他，而他也爱你，那么，在你们这种情况下，最好就结婚。难道你还在婚姻和外遇之间犹豫吗？”



“But why don’t you want the divorce?” asked the doctor, beginning to feel irritated. “You are a strange woman. How strange you are! If you are fond of him in earnest and he loves you too, in your position you can do nothing better than get married. Can you really hesitate between marriage and adultery?”



“我明白你的意思，”她说，从他面前走开，她的脸现出恶狠狠的报复神情。“我非常了解你。你讨厌我了，你想甩掉我，才硬要和我离婚。“多谢”，我可不是你想象的那种傻瓜。离婚我可不干，我不离开你，不离，不离开！第一，我不愿意失掉我的社会地位，”她很快地说下去，仿佛生怕人家不容她多说似的，“第二，我已经二十七岁，尼斯却只有二十三岁；过上一年他就会嫌弃我，丢开我。第三，不瞒您说，我也不敢担保我这种迷恋能够维持很久……就是这么回事！我不会离开你。”


“I understand you,” she said, walking away from him, and a spiteful, vindictive expression came into her face. “I understand you perfectly. You are sick of me, and you simply want to get rid of me, to force this divorce on me. Thank you very much; I am not such a fool as you think. I won’t accept the divorce and I won’t leave you–I won’t, I won’t! To begin with, I don’t want to lose my position in society,” she continued quickly, as though afraid of being prevented from speaking. “Secondly, I am twenty-seven and Riss is only twenty-three; he’ll be tired of me in a year and throw me over. And what’s more, if you care to know, I’m not certain that my feeling will last long . . . so there! I’m not going to leave you.”



“那我就把你从家里赶出去！”尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇跺着脚喊道。“我把你赶出去，你个无耻、令人作呕的女人！”


“Then I’ll turn you out of the house!” shouted Nikolay Yevgrafitch, stamping. “I shall turn you out, you vile, loathsome woman!”



“那就走着瞧吧！”她说着走出去了。

外面，天已经大亮，可是医生一直坐在桌子边，拿着铅笔在纸上划来划去，机械地写道：

“亲爱的先生🖕……小脚”


“We shall see!” she said, and went out.

It was broad daylight outside, but the doctor still sat at the table moving the pencil over the paper and writing mechanically.

“My dear Sir. . . . Little foot.”



要不然，他就走来走去，在会客室里那张七年以前，他们婚后不久拍的照片前面站住，看上很久。那是一张全家合照，有他的岳父、岳母和他的妻子奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜，那时候她二十岁，还有他自己，当时是个年轻、幸福的丈夫。他的岳父一把胡子刮得很干净，患有水肿的枢密院官员，狡诈而贪婪。他的岳母是个胖女人，脸孔显得又小又凶，像是黄鼠狼，她发疯般地爱自己的女儿，处处帮她的忙，哪怕她女儿要勒死人，这个母亲也不会说她一句话，反而会撩起自己的衣裾来把女儿遮住。奥尔迦·德米特利耶芙娜的脸也是又小又凶，然而她的凶相比她母亲更露骨，更明显，她已经不是黄鼠狼，而是大得多的猛兽！尼古拉·叶甫格拉菲奇呢，在这张照片上却显得是个老实人，一个善良、质朴的青年。在他的脸上绽开宗教学校学生的温和笑容。命运无意间把他推到那群豺狼中去，他却天真地相信，她会给他诗情，给他幸福，以及从前他在大学里唱着“不恋爱就无异于浪费青春”那首歌的时候所梦想的一切。




Or he walked about and stopped in the drawing-room before a photograph taken seven years ago, soon after his marriage, and looked at it for a long time. It was a family group: his father-in-law, his mother-in-law, his wife Olga Dmitrievna when she was twenty, and himself in the rôle of a happy young husband. His father-in-law, a clean-shaven, dropsical privy councillor, crafty and avaricious; his mother-in-law, a stout lady with small predatory features like a weasel, who loved her daughter to distraction and helped her in everything; if her daughter were strangling someone, the mother would not have protested, but would only have screened her with her skirts. Olga Dmitrievna, too, had small predatory-looking features, but more expressive and bolder than her mother’s; she was not a weasel, but a beast on a bigger scale! And Nikolay Yevgrafitch himself in the photograph looked such a guileless soul, such a kindly, good fellow, so open and simple-hearted; his whole face was relaxed in the naïve, good-natured smile of a divinity student, and he had had the simplicity to believe that that company of beasts of prey into which destiny had chanced to thrust him would give him romance and happiness and all he had dreamed of when as a student he used to sing the song “Youth is wasted, life is nought, when the heart is cold and loveless.”


他又大惑不解地问自己：他，一个乡村教士的儿子，一个受过宗教学校教育的学生，一个质朴的、粗鲁的、直心眼的人，怎么会那么软弱无力地落在这个渺小的、虚伪的、庸俗的、浅薄的、在天性方面跟他迥然不同的人的手里。


And once more he asked himself in perplexity how he, the son of a village priest, with his democratic bringing up–a plain, blunt, straightforward man–could have so helplessly surrendered to the power of this worthless, false, vulgar, petty creature, whose nature was so utterly alien to him.



十点多钟，他穿上外衣，要到医院去了，这时候女佣走进书房来。

“有什么事？”他问。

“太太起床了，她请求您把昨天您答应给她的二十五个卢布给她。”


When at eleven o’clock he put on his coat to go to the hospital the servant came into his study.

“What is it?” he asked.

“The mistress has got up and asks you for the twenty-five roubles you promised her yesterday.”
